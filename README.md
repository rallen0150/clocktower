### This code is to find how many chimes occur between a time range. 
Each chime is equivalent to the hour the hour hand is on.
  * The chimes only occur at the top of the hour.
  * The hours are given on a **24 hour format**.
  *  The chimes however only chime on a 12 hour format.
     * Examples:
       * 15:00 - 17:00 chimes *11* times.
       * 2:00 - 3: 00 chimes *5* times.
       * 2:30 - 4:40 chimes *7* times.
  * If the times are the same, then the code acts as if 24 hours has passed and not the same day.
